# Project 3: ft_PrintF

Re-create the printf function with required flags. Introduces structs and how to utilize them.


This project for me personally was more about learning better coding structure. 

I re-wrote this project about 9 times to prepare for the exam which will require us to write this project and GNL from scratch again during normal exam conditions.

I originally completed the bonuses but this heavily changes the program structure. So i focused on a simple version to pass and prepare for the exam. 

Final score: 100%
